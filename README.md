# Containerized CAPES

This is the repo for containerized CAPES.

This is not ready for deployment.

To do:
* Auto generate passphrases (replace `password` in all the config files with a generated one)
* Fix the landing page with the right ports for the apps
* Add Portainer to the landing page
* Replace HackMD with Etherpad on the landing page
* Replace Mattermost with Rocketchat on the landing page
* Wrap everything in a shell script
* Documentation (yay)
